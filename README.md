# litmap

A small, zero-build engine for **literary-geography maps** — plot the places,
routes and characters of a text on an interactive OpenStreetMap, driven
entirely by a `config.json` and GeoJSON data. No framework, no build step:
plain HTML/CSS/JS + [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/).

This repository is a **GitHub template**. Click **“Use this template”** to start
a new project; it ships with a tiny working demo you then replace.

## The idea

```
engine/        the reusable machine (no project names in the code)
config.json    your project: works, groups, colours, strings, view, basemap
data/          your places & routes as GeoJSON
```

> A new project = edit `config.json` + add `data/`. You should never need to
> touch `engine/`. See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and the
> diagram [`docs/engine-vs-project.svg`](docs/engine-vs-project.svg).

## Quick start

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000     # from the repo root
# open http://localhost:8000/   → the bundled "Demoville" demo
```

Then make it yours:

1. Edit **`config.json`** — site title, basemap, opening view + `regionBBox`,
   and your `works` (each with `groups`: label + colour).
2. Replace **`data/*.geojson`** with your features. Each feature carries
   `story` (= a group key), `name`, `kind` (`place`/`route`), and optional
   `character`, `time`, `gloss`, `quote`, `ref`.
3. (Optional) Use **`pipeline/`** to build the GeoJSON from a hand-curated
   source (geocoding + routing) and to round-trip edits through uMap — see
   [`pipeline/README.md`](pipeline/README.md).
4. Push and enable GitHub Pages.

## Features (all shown by the demo)

- Multiple **works** with switchable tabs; optional **experimental** badge.
- Colour-coded, toggleable **groups** in an accordion sidebar; optional
  numbering, a group **prefix** (e.g. “Stop 1 · …”), per-group **badges**
  (e.g. clock times) and **hidden-by-default** thematic layers.
- **Points and routes**; **character** attribution and **time** chips.
- Scrollable **popups** (gloss / quote / reference), kept clear of the header;
  optional deep links into a public-domain **source text**, **further-reading**
  essays, **Wikidata** authority links and a **fictional-place** marker.
- A **region bounding box** for the opening view; far-off places stay reachable.
- **Mobile layout**: full-height map with the sidebar as a bottom sheet.

Shown by the real projects (not the demo):

- **Location-certainty halos** (`confidence`: high / medium / low) with a legend.
- A **persons register** (prosopography) — characters as stable ids, resolved
  to names, with their own collapsible sidebar section.
- One place in **several chapters** (`stories`), an **annotation overlay**
  edited with the bundled local tool, and a **consolidation** step.
- i18n is *prepared, not active*: strings are keyed by language, but the UI
  language is fixed to `site.defaultLang` (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`).

## Reference examples

Three real projects use this engine by copy (kept in sync with
`sync-engine.sh`, drift checked by `pipeline/check.py --mirror`):

- **Mapping Joyce** — the project the engine was extracted from (Joyce's
  *Dubliners* / *Ulysses* / *A Portrait …*; three works, an annotation overlay
  on a derived base layer, plus the text-processing / NER pipeline).
  Live: <https://hermesj.github.io/mappingJoyce/> ·
  Source: <https://github.com/hermesj/hermesj.github.io/tree/main/mappingJoyce>
- **Mapping Perutz** — Leo Perutz, *Zwischen neun und neun* (Vienna, one day);
  German-only UI, certainty halos, persons register, multi-chapter places,
  thematic hidden layers. Live: <https://hermesj.github.io/mappingPerutz/> ·
  Source: <https://github.com/hermesj/mappingPerutz>
- **Mapping Woolf** — Virginia Woolf, *Mrs Dalloway* (London, one day).

Mapping Joyce additionally demonstrates **one** way to *find and verify*
places — a spaCy NER pass over the public-domain text.

## Bringing your own data

That annotation step is **deliberately not part of litmap.** The engine only
cares that your `data/` matches the schema (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`); how you
compile it — close reading, an existing gazetteer, NER in any toolkit, QGIS, a
script of your own — is entirely up to you and your text's language. litmap
ships the rendering engine and a generic geocoding/routing/round-trip pipeline;
the *Mapping Joyce* example shows the NER route for those who want it.
